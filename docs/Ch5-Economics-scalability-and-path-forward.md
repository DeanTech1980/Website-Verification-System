# Chapter 5 - Economics, scalability and path forward

## Overview
This chapter examines the economic trade offs, funding models and market impacts of a Trusted Websites system, outlines scalability and resilience requirements for a global verification infrastructure, and proposes a staged roadmap to pilot, evaluate and expand the system while protecting inclusion, rights and competition.

---

## Economic considerations and funding models
- **Costs for website operators**
  - **Direct:** onboarding fees, renewal charges, third party compliance services.
  - **Indirect:** engineering work to meet technical hygiene, legal advice, and ongoing monitoring costs.
  - **Equity concern:** flat fees risk excluding small operators and community services.

- **Costs for authorities and verifiers**
  - Infrastructure (servers, mirrors, CDNs), security, staffing for reviews, appeals and customer support, third party audits, and legal/regulatory coordination.

- **User costs and benefits**
  - Users pay mainly indirectly (taxes, subscription models) but benefit from lower fraud exposure, reduced remediation costs and improved trust in online services.

- **Funding models**
  - **Tiered fees:** scaled pricing by operator size and sector; free or subsidised tiers for community, non‚Äëprofit and culturally important sites.
  - **Public funding plus cost recovery:** government seed funding for critical sectors with modest operator fees thereafter.
  - **Marketplace model:** accredited commercial verifiers compete for business under a regulated framework.
  - **Not‚Äëfor‚Äëprofit consortiums:** independent, mission driven verifiers for inclusion and public goods.

- **Incentives**
  - Reduced insurance premiums, preferential search/browsing treatment for verified sites, and public procurement preferences to encourage adoption.

---

## Market impacts and competition risks
- **Consolidation risk:** compliance costs could drive smaller sites off the open web or into hosted walled gardens.
- **Mitigations:** subsidised tracks, lightweight verification for low‚Äërisk services, and open standards to prevent vendor lock‚Äëin.
- **New markets:** compliance tooling, accessibility auditing, privacy preserving telemetry and accredited verifier services.

---

## Scalability, performance and resilience
- **Geographically distributed architecture**
  - Regional mirrors and decision nodes reduce latency and limit single points of failure.
  - Use of CDN and edge caches for credential metadata and revocation state.

- **Caching and token design**
  - Short‚Äëlived, cryptographically bound tokens minimise exposure from compromise while enabling aggressive local caching to avoid user visible delays.

- **Revocation and near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime enforcement**
  - Hybrid model: push notifications for critical revocations; pull/TTL for routine checks; regional failover to cached ‚Äúlast known good‚Äù state for availability.

- **Load management and abuse resistance**
  - API rate limiting, tiered quotas for third‚Äëparty integrations, authenticated client flows for browsers, and robust DDoS protection.

- **Privacy and telemetry at scale**
  - Aggregate, differential and privacy‚Äëpreserving telemetry to support monitoring without exposing individual browsing behaviour.

- **Security engineering**
  - Hardened key management, hardware security modules for signing, layered pen testing, continuous red teaming and mandatory third party audits.

---

## Interoperability and future proofing
- **Open standards**
  - Use verifiable credential formats and extend existing browser APIs to avoid bespoke vendor lock‚Äëin.
- **Support for emerging naming systems**
  - Accommodate decentralized domains, internationalised domain names and IoT‚Äëhosted endpoints.
- **Extensibility**
  - Modular policy engines to support sectoral rules (finance, health) and jurisdictional exemptions where necessary.

---

## Inclusion, affordability and accessibility
- **Tiered verification pathways**
  - Lightweight onboarding for low risk personal and community sites; more rigorous paths for high risk sectors.
- **Subsidy programmes**
  - Grants or fee waivers for small businesses, community organisations and sites serving under represented languages or regions.
- **Assisted onboarding**
  - Helpdesk, documentation in multiple languages and accredited local partners to reduce technical and administrative barriers.
- **Accessibility requirements**
  - Verification must include accessibility checks and provide remediation support, not just compliance burdens.

---

## Phased roadmap and KPIs
- **Phase 0 - Design and governance**
  - Convene multistakeholder working groups; publish standards and transparency commitments; legal review and human rights impact assessment.
  - KPIs: published standards; stakeholder sign‚Äëon; privacy impact assessment completed.

- **Phase 1 - Sector pilots**
  - Run tightly scoped pilots in finance, healthcare and government services where trust gains are highest.
  - KPIs: reduction in sector specific incidents; time‚Äëto‚Äëverify; operator onboarding success rate.

- **Phase 2 - Federated rollout**
  - Onboard accredited national verifiers; enable browser integration for participating vendors; open subsidised tracks for SMEs and civil society.
  - KPIs: percentage of high traffic domains verified; average verification cost; FP/FN rates.

- **Phase 3 - Broad adoption and iteration**
  - Expand coverage, continuous auditing and governance maturation; iterate UI/UX and exception mechanisms.
  - KPIs: user trust metrics, complaint volumes, systemic availability targets, equitable uptake across regions.

---

## Exit, exception and redress mechanisms
- **Exceptions framework**
  - Clearly defined, audited exception processes for protected anonymous speech, academic research and emergency access.
- **Appeals and independent review**
  - Independent adjudication panel with published timelines and anonymised case reporting.
- **Sunset and rollback planning**
  - Defined steps to roll back changes, revert enforcement or decentralise services if governance failures occur.

---

## Summary
A Trusted Websites system is economically intensive but can deliver large social returns through reduced fraud and stronger digital trust.
Success depends on careful funding design, strong inclusion mechanisms, distributed engineering, open standards and staged pilots with rigorous KPIs.
Prioritise privacy, human rights safeguards and subsidised tracks so the system raises the baseline of trust without excluding the web‚Äôs most valuable small and community actors.
