# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. To keep this repository consistent and discoverable:

- Write docs in Markdown, use Title Case for headings.
- Keep one H1 per page.
- Keep paragraphs 3 to 6 sentences where possible.
- Add YAML frontmatter to site pages with `title` and `description`.
- Add alt text for images in `assets/diagrams`.
- To propose changes: open an issue first, then submit a PR referencing the issue.

CI:
- Commits and PRs run a broken links check. Fix link failures before merging.

Editorial:
- Use active voice where possible and run a Markdown aware grammar check before merging.
